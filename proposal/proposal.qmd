## THE BIG MAC INDEX üçî

The [Big Mac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index) (BMI) was invented by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index) in 1986 as a light-hearted guide to whether currencies are at their ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù level. It is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP), with the notion that in the long run, exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalise the prices of an identical basket of goods and services (in this case, a burger) in any two countries. The BMI has become a global standard, included in several economic textbooks and the subject of dozens of academic studies.

According to [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/big-mac-index-purchasing-power-parity-burger-inflation/), *‚Äúgiven that McDonald‚Äôs is one of the biggest companies in the world and the Big Mac is widely available globally, it means that the famous burger can be used as a basic goods comparison between most countries‚Äù*. Thus, the BMI can be used to show inflation in burger prices across countries over time when compared in the same currency.

As seen in the visualisation below, there is constant movement in the prices of the Big Mac amongst countries. In some years, Switzerland is the most expensive while Venezuela has taken the top spot due to its hyperinflation problems. Thus, we would like to visually examine the phenomenon of inflation co-movement by looking at the similarities in inflation prices between countries through time, isolate groups with similar characteristics, and determine if the BMI is a suitable proxy to inflation prices.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT üí´

There is a significant gap in making complex economic data accessible to the general public and providing advanced analysis tools for professionals. Existing visualization tools, including government dashboards, often fail to cater effectively to both audiences. To address this, we propose an R Shiny-based interactive tool that leverages publicly available data, the Big Mac Index to simplify the understanding of global financial trends for laypersons while offering in-depth data exploration and modelling capabilities for analysts.

## LITERATURE REVIEW üìñ

According to Tiwari, Abakah, Gil-Alana, & Abakah (2021), co-movement of inflation is mainly fuelled by the fact that ‚Äúreal economic activity is also correlated across countries‚Ä¶ As a result, domestic inflation responds to correlated changes in the domestic demand, hence, co-movement in the business cycles could lead to commonality in inflation‚Äù. While inflation is commonly measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), there is not much research conducted on conducting a visual analysis on CPI and inflation. However, our data of BMI share similar characteristics to GDP, other global indices such as the Good Country Index, and socioeconomic indicators from sources such as the World Bank ‚Äì all these data are spatial-temporal multidimensional data. As pointed out by Priselac (2021), the three main issues of spatial-temporal data is

1\) ‚Äúthe continuous and discrete changes in spatial and non‚Äìspatial properties of spatial time object‚Äù,

2\) ‚Äúthe influence of collocated neighboring spatial time objects on each other‚Äù, and

3\) ‚Äúspace is two-dimensional and can move in an unlimited direction, while time can only move forward, i.e., it is one‚Äìdimensional‚Äù.

Some proposed methods are as follow:

We also acknowledge the impact of imports and exports on inflation co-movement ‚Äì according to Ho, Sarte, & Schwartzman (2023), ‚Äú*even without global shocks, the trade network alone is sufficient to generate substantial comovement in output growth and inflation*‚Äù. Such data that traces the economic exchanges between countries are often analysed with network analysis.

As such, given our data is of a spatial-temporal network nature, of particular interest is the article by Wang, et al. (2019) that studied how to visually analyse the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. They created an ‚Äú*an integration of space, time, and network analysis methods to support the linked analysis of trade network data and conflict events through anomaly detection and correlation analysis across imports, exports and triadic structures*‚Äù (Wang, et al., 2019).

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES üéØ

The team endeavors to meet three objectives from this project:

a\. First objective is to analyse the [*Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) utilising the Big Mac Index as a proxy gauge for inflation between countries in a light-hearted manner*]{.underline}. This will allow users to gain insights on their expenditure power abroad in comparison to their native country. As part of economic indicators, variables such as GDP deflator, GDP per Capita, Consumer Price Index, Imports and Exports, Wages will be used to validate this analysis as a form of univariate and bi-variate analysis.

b\. The second objective would be to [*build a time-series clustering network predictive model*]{.underline} in a bid to (1) analyse trends and patterns from a selected time period, (years 2000 ‚Äì 2023), (2) associate the patterns or countries into clusters based on associations/correlations, and (3) forecast projections of BM Index for the next 5 ‚Äì 10 years as part of a predictive model.

c\. The final objective would be to build an [*interactive dashboard with interactive means for the user to perform fine-tuning methods to gain insights*]{.underline}. This interactivity should allow a degree of autonomy to users such that they can gain from uni, bi, multi-variate analysis and the Network and Time-Series modelling that have been pre-built at the back-end of our application.1.

The combination of these datasets provides a comprehensive view of economic indicators, currency valuations, and purchasing power across different regions, enhancing the analytical depth of our project.

## LIMITATIONS ‚öôÔ∏è

The team was cognisant of the limitations of the dataset and project. Three limitations were identified:

#### Consistency of Data Set

One of the limitations of using Big Mac Index is in its consistency of valuation within a country. The index price inconsistency can be found within the different sub-regions and estates within the countries. To this end, the team will utilise appropriate statistical aggregation as the most appropriate representation of the BM Index of the selected country.

#### Granularity of Data

The next limitation of using the Big Mac Index would be its granularity The prices of sub-ingredients within the Big Mac such as flour, sugar, meat, lettuce and etc, would impact the overall Big Mac Index. The team will be doing a closer study on how this granularity and whether it is significant to stray a coherent analysis.

#### Effects of Fiscal Policies

Big Mac Prices Valuation would be artificially affected due to fiscal policies that the countries‚Äô governments introduced to suppress the effects of inflation, hence getting an undervalued Big Mac Index.

## ANALYSIS TASKS üìç

This is a list of analytical tasks for our visual analysis of BMI (*adapted from* Zhou, et al., 2017).

#### Spatial visualisation

We are interested in providing global and local views to show the levels of inflation for different countries in the world. We foresee the following challenges of 1) how can we measure the similarities between different countries with different dimensional features, 2) how can we present the spatial clusters with similar inflation trajectories, 3) how can we present the different spatial clusters, and 4) how can we present a comparative view of inflation trajectories of say two countries of interest?

#### Temporal visualisation

We want to show the trajectory of inflation over time in different countries. We foresee the following challenges of 1) how to have a deeper exploration of trajectories of the spatial clusters of interest, 2) how to track consistent spatial clusters across time intervals, 3) how to quantify these changes of spatial clusters over time, and 4) how to identify changing clusters with similar dimensional features over time?

#### Network visualisation

We want to show the directionality and weight of the trade amongst different countries. We foresee the following challenges of 1) how to investigate the different trade measures of a country of interest, 2) the possible influence between countries on their trade network, and 3), how do we group similar countries based on their trade trajectories and compare their trade networks?

#### Spatial-temporal multidimensional network visualisation

We want to integrate the spatial, temporal and network information seamlessly throughout the different visualisations we use. We foresee the challenges of 1) how do we allow quick reference to spatial clusters, 2) how do we showcase the temporal inflation trajectories of spatial clusters of interest, 3) how do we explore other spatial clusters that exhibit similar temporal and network dynamics that indicate inflation?

## METHODOLOGY üîç

![](/image/method.jpg){fig-align="center" width="610"}

Our analytical approach will encompass a structured and iterative data analysis and predictive modeling process, integrating various R libraries to handle specific tasks:

#### Data Wrangling

-   Leveraging R libraries such as \`dplyr\` for data manipulation and \`tidyr\` for data tidying, we will extract, clean, and preprocess data from diverse sources, ensuring data quality and consistency. Feature engineering will be conducted to enhance model input.

#### Data Sense Making

-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using \`ggplot2\` for data visualization, we will conduct univariate and bivariate analyses to uncover patterns and relationships within the Big Mac Index and economic indicators like GDP per capita.

-   Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA): With \`ggstatsplot\`, we will perform statistical tests to validate our initial EDA findings, seeking to establish confidence in the observed trends.

-   Multivariate Analysis: Advanced visualization techniques, possibly utilizing \`treemap\` or \`plotly\`, will help us depict the multi-faceted relationships in our dataset.

#### Multi-Dimensional Time Series Clustering

-   Geo-visualisation and analysis: Spatial data patterns will be explored using packages such as \`sf\` and \`ggmap\` to incorporate geographical context into the Big Mac Index analysis.

-   Time Series Clustering: The \`tsclust\` package will enable the identification of similar trajectories among countries' economic indicators over time, inform the clustering of countries based on these time-dependent patterns.

-   Network analysis: Trade relationship patterns between countries will be explored using packages such as ‚ÄòvisNetwork‚Äô to provide a network analysis to understanding the impact on trade on BMI.

#### Building a Predictive Model

-   Forecasting Model: We will apply time series forecasting techniques, utilizing packages like \`forecast\` and \`prophet\`, to predict future Big Mac Index values.

-   Fine Tuning Parameters: Our interactive dashboard, constructed using \`shiny\`, will allow users to adjust model parameters dynamically, enhancing the model's applicability to various analytical scenarios
