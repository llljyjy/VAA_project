    "text": "PROBLEM STATEMENT üí´\nThere is a significant gap in making complex economic data accessible to the general public and providing advanced analysis tools for professionals. Existing visualization tools, including government dashboards, often fail to cater effectively to both audiences. To address this, we propose an R Shiny-based interactive tool that leverages publicly available data, the Big Mac Index to simplify the understanding of global financial trends for laypersons while offering in-depth data exploration and modelling capabilities for analysts."

    "section": "LITERATURE REVIEW üìñ",
    "text": "LITERATURE REVIEW üìñ\nAccording to Tiwari, Abakah, Gil-Alana, & Abakah (2021), co-movement of inflation is mainly fuelled by the fact that ‚Äúreal economic activity is also correlated across countries‚Ä¶ As a result, domestic inflation responds to correlated changes in the domestic demand, hence, co-movement in the business cycles could lead to commonality in inflation‚Äù. While inflation is commonly measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), there is not much research conducted on conducting a visual analysis on CPI and inflation. However, our data of BMI share similar characteristics to GDP, other global indices such as the Good Country Index, and socioeconomic indicators from sources such as the World Bank ‚Äì all these data are spatial-temporal multidimensional data. As pointed out by Priselac (2021), the three main issues of spatial-temporal data is\n1) ‚Äúthe continuous and discrete changes in spatial and non‚Äìspatial properties of spatial time object‚Äù,\n2) ‚Äúthe influence of collocated neighboring spatial time objects on each other‚Äù, and\n3) ‚Äúspace is two-dimensional and can move in an unlimited direction, while time can only move forward, i.e., it is one‚Äìdimensional‚Äù.\nSome proposed methods are as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of data\nVisual Analytics Methods\nAuthors\n\n\n\n\nGood Country Index,\nSocial Progress Index,\nGlobal Innovation Index,\nGlobal Creativity Index,\nSocial Progress Index,\nHuman Development index etc.\n\nSpatial autocorrelation (Cluster and outlier analysis)\nHot spot analysis\nGrouping analysis\n\nTan & Dramowicz (2016)\n\n\nGDP data\n\nSpatial clustering\nTemporal visualization (using streamlines)\nInteractivity\n\nZhou, et al.¬†(2017)\n\n\nTraffic data\n\nCluster analysis\nTemporal Fingerprinting Through Circular Heat Maps\nSpatio-temporal Comparison Through Circular Heat Map Subtraction\nTemporal Behaviour Characterisation Through Label Maps\n\nDhont, Tsiporkova, Tourw√©, & Gonz√°lez-Deleito (2020)\n\n\nGDP, inflation rate, employment rate, Gini index etc.\n\nCluster Analysis\nPrediction modelling using Regression and Classification\n\nPriselac (2021)\n\n\nWorld Bank Open data\n\nCluster analysis\nK-means and PCA\nAgglomerative Clustering with ‚Äòcosine‚Äô metric and T-SNE\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nDTW Barycenter Averaging with K-Means and T-SNE\nDTW Barycenter Averaging with KMeans and LSTMAutoencoder\n\nSoƒáko (2023)\n\n\n\nWe also acknowledge the impact of imports and exports on inflation co-movement ‚Äì according to Ho, Sarte, & Schwartzman (2023), ‚Äúeven without global shocks, the trade network alone is sufficient to generate substantial comovement in output growth and inflation‚Äù. Such data that traces the economic exchanges between countries are often analysed with network analysis.\nSome proposed methods are as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of data\nVisual Analytics Methods\nAuthors\n\n\n\n\nExport data\n\nNetwork analysis with geo layout algorithm\nModularity/Community analysis\nTopological analysis e.g.¬†betweenness centrality analysis\n\nG√∂n√ßer-Demiral & ƒ∞nce-Yenilmez (2022)\n\n\nGlobal trade network data (import and export)\n\nNetwork analysis with aggregation and network backbone extraction method\nEnrich network information on each country with embedded geographical, cultural and political features\nERGM and STERGM\nGoodness of fit\nCommunity analysis\n\nSetayesh, Zadeh, & Bahrak (2022)\n\n\n\nAs such, given our data is of a spatial-temporal network nature, of particular interest is the article by Wang, et al.¬†(2019) that studied how to visually analyse the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. They created an ‚Äúan integration of space, time, and network analysis methods to support the linked analysis of trade network data and conflict events through anomaly detection and correlation analysis across imports, exports and triadic structures‚Äù (Wang, et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of data\nVisual Analytics Methods\nAuthors\n\n\n\n\nTrade data, Stability data (governance indicators), Economic data (GDP, GDP per capita)\n\nCorrelation-based Country-Product Matrix\nAnomaly Time Series\nChoropleth view\nTrade diffusion graph\nClustering and Comparison\n\nG√∂n√ßer-Demiral & ƒ∞nce-Yenilmez (2022)"

    "text": "PROJECT OBJECTIVES üéØ\nThe team endeavors to meet three objectives from this project:\na. First objective is to analyse the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) utilising the Big Mac Index as a proxy gauge for inflation between countries in a light-hearted manner. This will allow users to gain insights on their expenditure power abroad in comparison to their native country. As part of economic indicators, variables such as GDP deflator, GDP per Capita, Consumer Price Index, Imports and Exports, Wages will be used to validate this analysis as a form of univariate and bi-variate analysis.\nb. The second objective would be to build a time-series clustering network predictive model in a bid to (1) analyse trends and patterns from a selected time period, (years 2000 ‚Äì 2023), (2) associate the patterns or countries into clusters based on associations/correlations, and (3) forecast projections of BM Index for the next 5 ‚Äì 10 years as part of a predictive model.\nc. The final objective would be to build an interactive dashboard with interactive means for the user to perform fine-tuning methods to gain insights. This interactivity should allow a degree of autonomy to users such that they can gain from uni, bi, multi-variate analysis and the Network and Time-Series modelling that have been pre-built at the back-end of our application.1."

    "text": "LIMITATIONS ‚öôÔ∏è\nThe team was cognisant of the limitations of the dataset and project. Three limitations were identified:\n\nConsistency of Data Set\nOne of the limitations of using Big Mac Index is in its consistency of valuation within a country. The index price inconsistency can be found within the different sub-regions and estates within the countries. To this end, the team will utilise appropriate statistical aggregation as the most appropriate representation of the BM Index of the selected country.\n\n\nGranularity of Data\nThe next limitation of using the Big Mac Index would be its granularity The prices of sub-ingredients within the Big Mac such as flour, sugar, meat, lettuce and etc, would impact the overall Big Mac Index. The team will be doing a closer study on how this granularity and whether it is significant to stray a coherent analysis.\n\n\nEffects of Fiscal Policies\nBig Mac Prices Valuation would be artificially affected due to fiscal policies that the countries‚Äô governments introduced to suppress the effects of inflation, hence getting an undervalued Big Mac Index."
